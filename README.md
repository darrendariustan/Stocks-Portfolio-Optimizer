2. Create a new Web Service 
3. Use the following build command to ensure all dependencies are properly installed and the PyPortfolioOpt patch is applied:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python patch_pypfopt.py
   ```
4. Set the start command to:
   ```
   streamlit run finapp_final.py
